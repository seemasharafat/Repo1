4.Copy the jenkins.war file from this and place into another directly of system
5.Now go to cmd and go to folder where jenkins.war is copied and then copy below command
	java -jar jenkins.war 
6.open browser and type below url

it wil ask u to authenticate jenkins	

If need to deploy jenkins with tomcat:
1.copy jenkins.war in webapp folder and run startup.batch file frmo bi folder
2.type http://localhost:8080/jenkins

Now Tomcat is used for my proj and runs on 8080 so if want to run jenkins standalone and want to execute on another port type below command
java -jar jenkins.war --httPort=9090
